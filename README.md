# Movie Genre Classification

This project aims to classify movies into different genres based on their descriptions using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning**.

##  Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Deep Learning Model**: A Neural Network (Sequential) built using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Data Splitting**: Training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.


##  Dependencies
Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib nltk tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Results
- Model accuracy and classification metrics are reported at the end of the notebook.
- Visualization of data distribution and model performance.
